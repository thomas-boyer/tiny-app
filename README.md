# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full-stack web app that can shorten URLs and save the results, called TinyURLs, to a database. It also keeps track of the logged-in user and what TinyURLs that user has created. A TinyURL can be modified, but only by the creator of that TinyURL, if they are logged in.
